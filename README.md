# HOSVD Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) in Python. The HOSVD is a tensor decomposition method used for multidimensional data analysis and dimensionality reduction.

## Notebook Contents

- **Introduction**: Brief overview of HOSVD and its applications.
- **Tensor Basics**: Introduction to tensors and their properties.
- **HOSVD Algorithm**: Detailed explanation of the HOSVD algorithm.
- **Implementation**: Python code implementing the HOSVD algorithm.
- **Example**: Example usage of the HOSVD implementation on a sample tensor.
- **Conclusion**: Summary and closing remarks.

## Usage

1. Open the `Hosvd_implementation.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow along with the explanations and code cells.
3. Experiment with the provided example or apply the HOSVD implementation to your own tensors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
